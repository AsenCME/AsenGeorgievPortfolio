## Adititonal Info

I upload some of my projects on my portfolio - projects that I have worked on professionaly or projects that I have participated in competitions with. I started web development in 9th grade (age of 15 in Bulgaria). However, I took greater interest in design. With that said, the portfolio has been designed entirely by me and only some of the projects in it.
